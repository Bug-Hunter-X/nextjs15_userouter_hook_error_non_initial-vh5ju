# Next.js 15: useRouter Hook Error in Non-Initially Rendered Pages

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when using the `useRouter` hook within pages that are not initially rendered on the client-side.  The error arises because `useRouter` requires the routing context to be available, which isn't the case during the initial server-side render if the page is accessed directly.

## Problem

The `useRouter` hook, when placed in a page component that's not the initial page loaded in the client, throws an error since the router context might not be initialized during the initial render. This typically happens when directly navigating to a page other than the home page.

## Solution

To resolve this, avoid using `useRouter` directly in pages that are not initially loaded. Instead, employ alternative strategies like `getServerSideProps` to fetch data during the server-side render.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You'll encounter the error on the initially faulty code.
5. Then review the working example in `bugSolution.js`.
